Introduction
============

Warp is a web framework based on `Twisted Web`_, using the `Storm`_ ORM, `Mako`_ templating, and `jQuery`_.

It's designed to be batteries-included (auth, sessions, URL routing, CRUD, access control, etc), easy to get started with, and capable of leveraging all the power of `Twisted`_.

.. _jQuery: http://jquery.com/


Warp is currently being developed by `Brendon Hogger`_ for `Cogini`_, but it's `open source
<http://github.com/brendonh/warp/>`_ and help is more than welcome. 

Warp has an IRC channel, **#warp**, on `Freenode`_.
